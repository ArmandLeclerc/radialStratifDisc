# Radial stratification on local and global waves in astrophysical discs
This repository contains the Mathematica and Jupyter notebooks treating the wave equation in radially stratified protoplanetary discs,
which were used in the paper by A.Leclerc, G.Laibe, E.Lynch and N.Perez.

The Mathematica notebook computes the Berry curvature of the acoustic waves in the local propagation.
The Jupyter notebook solves for the global wave modes, using the Dedalus package.
